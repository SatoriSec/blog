## üîê Security Note

When `--org` mode is used, the tool uses the default `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` to assume roles into member accounts.

For better security and least privilege:
- Use a **delegated admin account**
- Create a dedicated IAM role for scanning (e.g., `OrgScannerRole`)
- Restrict access to only required services

‚ö†Ô∏è This role delegation feature is not yet implemented but is planned for future releases.

## 30-Day AWS CDK Python Agenda

Get ready for an exciting 30-day journey into AWS infrastructure as code with Python!
You’ll start from the very basics—setting up your environment—and quickly move on to building, deploying, and securing real-world cloud solutions.

Each day, you’ll tackle hands-on projects and security-focused challenges, gradually mastering the power of AWS CDK to automate and protect your cloud resources.

By the end, you’ll have the confidence and skills to design, deploy, and secure any AWS infrastructure using code.

Let’s make your cloud dreams a reality—one day, one project at a time!

1. **Introduction and Setup**
    - Install and configure Python, AWS CLI, Node.js, npm, and AWS CDK on Ubuntu.
2. **Your First CDK App**
    - Initialize and explore your first CDK Python project structure.
3. **CDK Bootstrapping**
    - Prepare your AWS account for CDK deployments by running the bootstrap command.
4. **Deploying a Simple Stack**
    - Deploy your first stack to AWS and check the results.
5. **Destroying a Stack**
    - Learn how to safely remove a stack using CDK.
6. **Static Website Hosting with Security**
    - Build a static website using S3 and CloudFront, and enable encryption and access logging.
7. **Serverless API with Lambda and API Gateway**
    - Create a REST API with API Gateway and Lambda, and enforce HTTPS and IAM authentication.
8. **Database Backend with DynamoDB**
    - Add a DynamoDB table to your API, enable encryption at rest, and restrict access using IAM roles.
9. **Secure Secrets Management**
    - Store sensitive configuration in AWS Secrets Manager, and grant Lambda access to secrets securely.
10. **Automated File Processing with S3 and Lambda**
    - Process files uploaded to S3 using Lambda, and enforce bucket encryption and access controls.
11. **Scheduled Lambda Jobs with EventBridge**
    - Schedule Lambda functions with EventBridge, and enforce least privilege IAM roles for the event target.
12. **Secure Queue Processing with SQS and Lambda**
    - Process messages asynchronously with SQS and Lambda, and enforce encryption for SQS queues.
13. **Multi-Stage Deployments with Security Context**
    - Deploy your stack to dev and prod environments, and enforce environment-specific security policies.
14. **VPC Networking with Security Groups and NACLs**
    - Create a VPC with public and private subnets, and configure security groups and NACLs for strict network access.
15. **EC2 Instance with Security Hardening**
    - Launch an EC2 instance in your private subnet, enforce SSH key-based authentication, and restrict inbound access.
16. **RDS Database with Encryption and Backup**
    - Deploy an RDS database in your private subnet, enable encryption at rest and in transit, and set up automated backups.
17. **Private API Endpoints and VPC Endpoints**
    - Make your API accessible only within your VPC, and use VPC endpoints for secure AWS service access.
18. **Secure File Storage with S3 and KMS**
    - Set up S3 buckets with KMS encryption, strict bucket policies, and access logging.
19. **IAM Role Restrictions and Policy Boundaries**
    - Apply least privilege access to all resources, and use IAM policy boundaries to restrict role permissions.
20. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Enforcement**
    - Enforce MFA for sensitive AWS operations using IAM conditions and custom policies.
21. **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Integration**
    - Protect your API and website with AWS WAF, and configure rules to block common threats.
22. **Encryption at Rest and in Transit for All Resources**
    - Enable encryption for all data stored and transferred, including S3, RDS, DynamoDB, and SQS.
23. **Audit Logging with CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs**
    - Set up AWS CloudTrail for account activity logging, and forward logs to CloudWatch for monitoring.
24. **Cross-Account Security with IAM Roles**
    - Share resources securely between AWS accounts using IAM roles and assume role policies.
25. **Custom Security Constructs and CDK Nag**
    - Build reusable security patterns as custom CDK constructs, and use CDK Nag for automated security checks.
26. **Security Automation with Lambda and EventBridge**
    - Automate security checks and remediation using Lambda and EventBridge, and trigger alerts for suspicious activity.
27. **Container Security with ECS and Secrets**
    - Deploy a secure container using ECS, inject secrets from Secrets Manager or SSM, and restrict network access.
28. **Secure CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline and IAM**
    - Build a CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline, enforce strict IAM permissions, and enable pipeline artifact encryption.
29. **Real-World Application with All Security Best Practices**
    - Build a small, complete application (like a blog or todo app) with all security best practices applied.
30. **Final Review and Next Steps**
    - Review your progress, assess your security posture, and plan your next AWS CDK project.

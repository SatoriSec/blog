# Welcome!

Hi ‚Äî I'm Raj Ganesh, and welcome to my blog.

This is my personal space to be creative, learn, and practice. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked at the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud, and product ‚Äî partnering with Fortune 100 companies to solve some of their most complex security challenges.

With 25+ years in cybersecurity and cloud architecture, I‚Äôve helped organizations shape their threat and vulnerability management programs, led red team operations, guided secure AWS implementations, and designed strategies that balance security with business needs. I‚Äôve also trained developers on secure coding practices and led teams delivering assessments at scale ‚Äî across industries like finance, healthcare, and technology.

Here, you‚Äôll explore a variety of topics, including Golang, Rust, Python programming, security tools, AWS implementations, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You'll also learn about automation and infrastructure as code, helping you streamline your workflows and manage cloud environments more efficiently.
This blog is designed to be a resource for both beginners and experienced developers, offering practical tutorials and insights to enhance your skills.

Happy learning!

# Welcome!

Hi — I'm Raj Ganesh, and welcome to my blog.

This is my personal space to be creative, learn, and practice. Over the years, I’ve worked at the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud, and product — partnering with Fortune 100 companies to solve some of their most complex security challenges.

With 25+ years in cybersecurity and cloud architecture, I’ve helped organizations shape their threat and vulnerability management programs, led red team operations, guided secure AWS implementations, and designed strategies that balance security with business needs. I’ve also trained developers on secure coding practices and led teams delivering assessments at scale — across industries like finance, healthcare, and technology.

You'll find ideas here ranging from security and product strategy to hands-on experiments, tool evaluations, and personal observations from the field.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This blog is a personal learning and experimentation space. Please validate and test any tools or techniques in your own environment before using them elsewhere.

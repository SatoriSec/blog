# Why I Named My GitHub "SatoriSec"

I’ve spent a lot of time working in cybersecurity, especially around automation, compliance, and SQL-based threat analysis.

Over the years, I ran into the same problem again and again:  
> **Too much information. Not enough clarity.**

I was dealing with **information overload** — too much to learn, too many focus areas. It was hard to know whether to be a polymath or a specialist.

Then, something clicked.

I stopped chasing shiny tools and started focusing on real problems. I learned what tools actually helped and took time to go deeper. That change really stuck with me..

In Japanese, that moment is called **Satori (悟り)**.

It means a kind of sudden awareness or insight — when things just **make sense**, and you **see clearly**.

That’s what I wanted my GitHub or website to reflect.

## So I called it **SatoriSec**.

- **Satori** for insight.
- **Sec** for security.

It’s not just about building tools.  
It’s about helping people **see what matters**, reduce noise, and act with clarity.

## SAML 2.0


SAML 2.0 is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.

Additionally, SAML 2.0 assertions are signed, which adds an extra layer of security.


There are many videos out there that teaches hands on skills, but the intend of the following videos is to teach WHY it was created in the first place and what problems it solves.

### Start by working backwards:


Sign up for the exam and create a study plan that works backwards from the exam date. This will give you a clear idea of what areas you need to focus on and what topics you need to master.


### Use practice exams:


Practice exams are a great way to evaluate your current gaps in knowledge and identify areas that you need to work on. Tutorialdojo offers a wide range of practice exams that can help with it.

### Utilize AWS documentation and videos:


The AWS documentation and videos, such as those from re:Invent, are a great resource for learning about the different services and features offered by AWS. Make sure to take advantage of these resources to build a solid understanding of the platform.


### Hands-on experience is key:


Hands-on experience is key to understanding the intricacies of AWS. Try to lab up as much as possible to get a deeper understanding of the platform and how it works.


### Practice, practice, practice:


The key to passing the certification is practice. The more questions you practice, the more comfortable you will become with the material and the better prepared you will be for the exam.


### Identify areas of interest:


The AWS Professional certification covers a wide range of topics, so it's important to identify the services or topics that interest or relate to you. This will not only make the learning process more enjoyable, but it will also help you focus on the areas that are most important for your specific field of work.


### Dive deep and master key topics:


Once you have cleared the fundamentals, focus on diving deep and mastering key topics like EC2, CloudFront, S3, SNS, KMS, API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, etc. These are in-demand services and having expertise in these areas can open up new job opportunities and make you a subject matter expert in your field. As a subject matter expert in key AWS services, you will be in high demand. Leverage your expertise to land lucrative job offers or take on challenging projects that require your specialized knowledge.


### Don't get discouraged if you don't pass:


If you don't pass the certification on your first try, don't get discouraged. It's not the end of the world and it's a common occurrence for many test-takers. Instead, focus on what you need to improve and retake the exam as soon as possible while the knowledge is still fresh in your mind. Keep in mind that if you prepare twice, it's going to stick with you for a longer time. So, if you don't pass the first time, think of it as an opportunity to solidify your knowledge and skills.


It's important to remember that the main objective of the certification is not just to pass the exam, but to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in your work and complete projects using AWS. With the right approach and determination, anyone can pass the AWS Professional certification in a shorter time frame.

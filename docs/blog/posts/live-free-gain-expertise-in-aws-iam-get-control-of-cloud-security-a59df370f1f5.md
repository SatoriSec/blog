Hello All -


I wanted to reach out to you to let you know about an exciting opportunity to gain expertise in cloud security — a free course on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).


[**https://iam.bhuvanpati.com**](https://iam.bhuvanpati.com)


AWS IAM is a crucial component of any cloud security strategy, and this course — AWS IAM Bootcamp: Gain Expertise in Cloud Security — is designed to give you a deep understanding of IAM and how to use it to secure your cloud resources. You’ll learn how to create and manage IAM users and groups, how to assign permissions to access AWS resources, and how to use IAM policies to secure your cloud resources. You’ll also delve into advanced topics like IAM roles and cross-account access, and learn how to troubleshoot issues related to IAM.


This course is completely free, but spaces are limited. If you are serious about learning IAM and gaining expertise in cloud security, I encourage you to sign up as soon as possible to secure your spot.

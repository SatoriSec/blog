Ikigai is a special thing that helps you find what makes you happy and gives your life a purpose. It's all about finding the things you love to do, the things you're good at, the things that are useful to other people, and the things you can get paid for. When these four things overlap and work together, it can make you feel really good and fulfilled. Some people find their ikigai through their job or their hobbies, and others find it through their friends or family. It's different for everyone, but the most important thing is to follow your passions and be open to new experiences.

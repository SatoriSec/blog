Every time I drive by a construction site around my neighborhood, I always tell the same thing to my kids. Ofcourse, they make fun of me. But I still tell them how cool it is to watch the process. You start with an ugly piece of land that turns into a beautiful building, mall, office complex, or someone's home. It's amazing to see the transformation happen right before your eyes, but what people don't realize is all the hard work, patience, and planning that went into it.

Just like construction, when you want to learn something new and acquire a skill, it also takes time, effort and patience. For example, if you want to learn how to play an instrument, you have to practice every day, even if you don't feel like it. Or if you want to learn how to cook, you have to keep trying new recipes and experimenting with different ingredients.


Learning something new is like going on a long journey, and sometimes it can be tough. You might not get it right the first time, or it might take longer than you thought. But it's important to remember that success doesn't happen right away. Just like construction, it takes time to build something great.


It's important to stay motivated and remember that it's worth it. Just like a construction process, it may not look like anything is happening at first, but if wait, we will see progress. For example, if you're learning how to ride a bike, you might fall a few times at first, but if you keep practicing, eventually you'll be able to ride without help. This can be extended to anything you want to learn.


Next time you drive by a construction site, remember that like the building being built, your progress and achievements come from trying hard, waiting and being patient. Keep going, stay motivated and don't give up on what you're learning because, in the end, it will all be worth it. Whether you're learning to play a sport, a new language or how to draw, remember the hard work and dedication the construction workers put into building the beautiful building you see, and apply the same to your skills.
